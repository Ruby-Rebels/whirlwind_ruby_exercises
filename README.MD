### Answers to the Whirlwind Ruby Exercises

If something in here doesn't make sense, please let me know

I only used concepts we have gone over, so you should be able to understand
what is going on.

Please be sure to look at the bonus and try to understand why I changed from
using an array to using a hash to store the information.

Feel free to fork/clone this repo and work with the exercises yourself.
